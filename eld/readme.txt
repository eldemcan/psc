Paint Shop problem

-To solve this problem I developed an algorithm based on backtrack algorithm
-In addition, I developed another algorithm which brute forces all possibilities to see which one is suitable
(this was created for testing purposes)
-There is a random problem generator which generates random cases, again mainly created for testing purpose
-I made classes's attributes public on purpose of readability
-First I wrote unit tests for brute force method and I test main method using brute force method
-You can run the program with different algorithms
  -  -i <name of the input.txt>  this will read given .txt file and output the solution if any
  -  -r <number of colors> <number of customers> this will use random problem generator and generate one problem with given parameters

-Project can be imported into inteliji IDEA it is a maven project

Enjoy!!!
